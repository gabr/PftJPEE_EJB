1.There are four projects altogether:
  a)  Lab2-EAR - the container project for ejb and client modules. Contains sun-resources.xml file
    configuring the JDBC connection pool and JDBC data source. There is NO need to create them manually
    using Glassfish administration console. Please make sure there is neither jdbc/db JDBC resource
    nor db_pool JDBC Connection Pool created manually on the server.
  b)  Lab2-EAR-ejb - EJB module, here you put your session beans (stateless, with remote user interface).
    This project should reference Lab2-EAR-console.jar directly (not as a project).
  c)  Lab2-EAR-client - Application Client module, here you put your controller and view part. Do NOT run this
    project explicitly. This project should reference Lab2-EAR-console.jar directly (not as a project).
  d)  Lab2-EAR-console - here you put your @Remote session bean interface and entity classes. They will issue
    a warning about missing persistence unit which you can safely ignore.

2.The project assumes that db database with db_user, db_pass credentials is available, as in the previous project.

3.In persistence.xml file add your entity classes using Add Class... button in Design view, or in Source view
  add for each entity <class>fully.qualified.name.of.the.Class</class>. Although I initially told you this is
  not necessary, it is indeed required because we have the entities in an external JAR.
  It will not be required starting from project 3.

4.Follow the package naming convention proposed in the previous report, which means you should include your
  last name and first name in the package name.
